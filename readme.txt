in windows you can't use emacs obviously so I went to the github documents folder and added this file, then I did "git add read" to add to the staging area or you can do "git -a -m commit add the readme file" where -a adds to the staging area automatically and -m allows you to add the message in the same comman "add the readme file" and then finally there is commit which commits the changes.
